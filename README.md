# Prism as framework
* Prism has many inbuilt features especially navigation service and module integration which helps any independent component to plugin easily without much effort
* Any independent component can have their own Views and Viewmodels which is not known to other components in its workflows.
* Any component which needs to navigate to a page of another component then needs to know the view name which is required as input to navigation service
